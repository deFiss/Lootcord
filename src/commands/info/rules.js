        2. **Do not use alt or "puppet" accounts.** The use of secondary accounts operated by you to avoid cooldowns, hoard weapons to avoid loss upon death, organize attacks on a target, farm cargo containers or in any other way considered unfair to others will result in a warning or in later offenses punishment.\n
        3. **Do not leave servers after attacking someone to deactivate your account and avoid counterattacks.** This is known as cooldown dodging, and is automatically reported to moderators on offense.\n
        4. **No kill-farming.** Killing someone then trading items back to the other person in order to gain kill count without consequences.\n
        5. **No handouts.** Giving another player free items/money whether it be through trading, the black market, clans, or kills is not allowed. Doing so will result in a warning or trade ban.\n
        6. **Do not report without reason.** The report command should only be used when you have evidence that someone is breaking these rules. Spamming the report command may result in a temporary or permanent ban.`)
